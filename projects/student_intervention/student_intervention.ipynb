    "**Answer: **\n",
    "This seemed a fairly crucial part of the process, so rather than pick out three to focus on I looked into all of them. I've chosen three here that seemed would be the best choices and/or best to practice with, but a more comprehensive (though less well formatted) answer can be found in model_evaluations.txt in the project folder of the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "  1. Classifying a person's cognitive activity based on brain imaging, as described here:\n",
    "    https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10601_sp09/lectures/NBayes2_2-2-2009-ann.pdf\n",
    "  2. GNB is efficient in both learning and predicting, and works well with a small feature-to-sample ratio. It outputs in probabilities, rather than binary classification, which can be useful in decision making based on predictions.\n",
    "  3. GNB is bad at regression. It also assumes conditional independence, so for datasets with strong intercorrelations it does poorly. It's a fairly simple model, and as such has a high bias and low variance as compared with other models (e.g. LR)\n",
    "  4.  Our dataset is fairly small, with a relatively large number of features, which is where Naive Bayes does well. It is also very efficient, which was a requirement of the job. I don't expect GNB to be the best choice, it's very simple and the assumptions that features are independent and fit a standard distribution may not be wise, but it can serve as a good baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Forest\n",
    "  1. \"Decision trees have been used for the detection of physical particles\", i.e. quarks. Source, along with many other \n",
    "examples, here:\n",
    "http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html\n",
    "  2. Decision trees work well with non-linear relationships and can provide very intuitive and easily visualized explanations for predictions. They work well out of the box, as feature selection is done automatically and doesn't require scaling. Random Forest is a bagging method which reduces the variance of decision trees, their biggest weakness.\n",
    "  3. Decision trees are prone to overfitting and local optima, though this is mitigated using Random Trees. It's also somewhat unstable, as small changes in the data have the potential to result in a completely different tree. The ease of interpretation breaks down as the model gets more complex, such as in an ensemble method like Random Forest.\n",
    "  4. Random Forest is accurate and efficient out of the box, doing the work of feature selection automatically and mitigating the problems of lone decision trees. It can also tell us the importance of each feature, which could potentially not only predict potential failures but provide actionable suggestions for interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Support Vector Machine\n",
    "  1. Text categorization, e.g. classifying Usenet News messages as computation, religion, statistics, etc. As described, \n",
    "along with other examples, here:\n",
    "https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0612817.pdf\n",
    "  2. Support vector machines are good at handling a large feature space, as well as non-linear relationships. They're versatile, and provide a lot of opportunity for tuning.\n",
    "  3. SVMs aren't great when the classes aren't seperable or there isn't enough margin (though a different kernel could alleviate those problems). They're also sensitive to feature scaling so, while versatile, their hyperparamater needs mean that it can be a lot of work to set up.\n",
    "  4. Looking at the data it seems a reasonable assumption that the relationship is non-linear. We also have a small dataset, so it should be very efficient."

We're trying to model a student who is at risk of not passing, leaving us very few examples of the sort of student we're looking for, so we desperately need to avoid overfitting - that is, not assuming the examples we do have are a perfect representation of all at risk students. Second, our feature set is likewise small but, more importantly, we don't know anything about how strong the effect of any given feature might be, both on the outcome and on the other features. Regardless of the model we choose we'll have to manage this somehow, but ideally we choose a model that doesn't just predict at risk students but is transparent enough to inform on why a student may be at risk. Then we not only know when to intervene, but have potential actionable suggestions as to how. Lastly, the question of efficiency. Frankly, this dataset is small enough that we'd be hard pressed to make a model that takes any significant resources making predictions, but that's no reason to be lazy about it.\n",

    "I mention in answer 3 that getting the weights out of the random forest classifier could be helpful. I didn't implement this either because I felt it was also outside the scope of the project, but I do believe it is a nice benefit that RFC does this automatically in this particular case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like I said in answer 5, the random state used had an enormous impact on the models. Usually the end result of tuning was an improvement, but it was frustrating to deal with. For some splits one model would be insurmountably worse than another for no other reason than the split. It would also affect the results of GridSearchCV, often quite a bit, and with the random forest it was especially difficult because the F1 score would max out at 1 so quickly that GridSearchCV would chose parameters seemingly arbitrarily. I had to watch the model's accuracy directly to figure out the best parameters, which seemed a bit of a hack and felt like it defeated the purpose of using GridSearchCV in the first place. It makes me feel not especially confident in the results, but I did the best I could given the dataset so hopefully it does alright."
