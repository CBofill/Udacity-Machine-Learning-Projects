# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Projects
This is a clone of the Udacity machine learning projects repo containing my work on all but the capstone project. Projects are found under /projects/ in their respective directories with individual readme files explaining how to run them. My capstone project can be seen [here](https://github.com/CBofill/analysis-of-the-sources-of-financial-burden-on-students-acquiring-upper-education).

## Projects
### Train a Smartcab How to Drive (Reinforcement Learning)
Found in /projects/smartcab  
Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.  

### Creating Customer Segments (Unsupervised Learning)
Found in /projects/creating\_customer\_segments  
Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.  

### Build A Student Intervention System (Supervised Learning)
Found in /projects/student_intervention  
Investigated the factors that affect a student's performance in high school. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on a given dataset to predict how likely a student is to pass. Selected the best model based on relative accuracy and efficiency.  

### Predicting Boston Housing Prices (Model Evaluation and Validation)  
Found in /projects/boston_housing  
Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
